The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for
NXP 'MKW41Z512xxx4' microcontroller using 'FRDM-KW41Z' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - Core Clock  =   20.97 MHz

 - 4 LEDs blink with fixed speed.
 - blinking is paused while holding down SW3/SW4 button.


The Blinky example is available in different targets:

  MKW41Z512xxx4 RAM:   configured for on-chip RAM
                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK2
                       (used for target debugging)

  MKW41Z512xxx4 Flash: configured for on-chip Flash
                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK2
                       (used for production or target debugging)

  MKW41Z512xxx4 MTB:   configured for on-chip Flash
                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as ULINK2
                       shows use of MTB (Micro Trace Buffer)


MTB (Micro Trace Buffer) Notes
-------------------------------
  - Dbg_MTB.ini file configures MTB settings, which allows to configure MTB RAM buffer size, buffer position, and flow control.
  - MTB allocates user-defined region of the system RAM for storing instruction address change-of-flow data packets.
    Modify MTB position and size to define the used memory region. The position must be a multiple of the buffer size.
    The allocated buffer region cannot be used as application RAM.
